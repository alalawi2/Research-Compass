## 🎯 How This Addresses Your Vision

### Your Original Vision:
> "start with dialogue about the research question...move to exploratory literature review...extensive literature review...literature synthesis...rationale...study design...sample size...statistical analysis plan...methods...timeline ethical approval...automatically populate to build the proposal"

### What's Working Now:

1. **✅ Dialogue about research question** → Phase 1 (COMPLETE)
   - Conversational AI-style interaction
   - Guided PICO framework
   - Validated research question output

2. **✅ Literature synthesis** → Phase 4 (COMPLETE) 
   - Theme extraction
   - Evidence grading
   - Gap analysis
   - Publication-ready tables
   - **THIS WAS THE CRITICAL GAP - NOW FILLED!**

3. **🔜 Exploratory literature review** → Phase 2 (SKELETON READY)
   - Will integrate with existing Literature Search tool
   - Structure in place, needs implementation

4. **🔜 Extensive literature review** → Phase 3 (SKELETON READY)
   - Will integrate with enhanced PubMed search
   - PRISMA flow diagram support
   - Structure in place, needs implementation

5. **🔜 Remaining phases** → Phases 5-11 (SKELETON READY)
   - All placeholders created
   - Navigation working
   - Ready for implementation
